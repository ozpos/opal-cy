Opal Ruby interface for Cytospace.js [ https://http://js.cytoscape.org// ].

Inspired by opal-d3, thank you.



It implements interface fairly closely following javascript API, except with blocks, classes, no camelcase etc.

About 60% of D3 APIs are implemented. Pull requests for the rest welcome.

For some examples check `demo` directory or [visit demo site](https://taw.github.io/opal-d3/).
