Opal Ruby interface for D3 [ https://d3js.org/ ].

It implements interface fairly closely following javascript API, except with blocks, classes, no camelcase etc.

About 60% of D3 APIs are implemented. Pull requests for the rest welcome.

For some examples check `demo` directory or [visit demo site](https://taw.github.io/opal-d3/).
